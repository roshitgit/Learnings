After you configure a host header or multiple host headers for an IP address, 
you must register the host headers with the appropriate name resolution system. 
If your computer is on an intranet, register the host header name or names with the 
intranet's name resolution system. If your computer is on the Internet, register the host 
header name or names with the Domain Name System (DNS), which is administered by InterNic.
