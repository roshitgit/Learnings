* Always have one clustered index created on table.
  Create Table Test(
    ID INT IDENTITY (1,1) primary key clustered,
    name [varchar](100),
    Address [varchar](max)
  )
* Always have clustered index on ID Identity column of "INT" which occupies 4 bytes of space.
  (i.e always create clustered index on unique columns. ex: ID identity column will always have unique values in it
    so its a primary candidate for clustered indexing)
* Never create clustered on "VARCHAR" columns.
* better to create non-clustered index on foreign keys.
