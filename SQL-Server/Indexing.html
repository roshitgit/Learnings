A) Indexing Facts:
* Always have one clustered index created on table.
  Create Table Test(
    ID INT IDENTITY (1,1) primary key clustered,
    name [varchar](100),
    Address [varchar](max)
  )
* Always have clustered index on ID Identity column of "INT" which occupies 4 bytes of space.
  (i.e always create clustered index on unique columns. ex: ID identity column will always have unique values in it
    so its a primary candidate for clustered indexing)
* Never create clustered on "VARCHAR" columns. Better to create non-clustered index on foreign keys.
* many non-clustered ones can be created in a single table on multiple columns
* Index seek is faster than index scan. Use query execution plan to decide on indexing. If a query is doing "Index Scan", 
  its a problem.
