****** Built in Lifetime Management within MS Unity

ContainerControlledLifetimeManager : singleton instance with dispose
HierarchicalLifetimeManager : singleton instance per container with dispose
TransientLifetimeManager : empty manager, always returns new object by resolve, no dispose!
PerRequestLifetimeManager (Unity.MVC) : singleton instance per http request with dispose
ExternallyControlledLifetimeManager : code must handle lifetime management
PerResolveLifetimeManager : like TransientLifetimeManager expect when in same object graph
PerThreadLifetimeManager : A LifetimeManager that holds the instances given to it, keeping one instance per thread.
