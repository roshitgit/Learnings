A) IIS has to impersonate using the identity of the windows AD domain account if SQL database is using "Windows Authentication"
   instead of "SQL server authentication or mixed mode".
B) IIS wont be able to run the MVC code and will give 401:Unauthorized exception if impersonation is not done

Follow the steps below to impersonate if:
* Web application is using MVC 4 Web API with VStudio 2010/2012/2013 and 
* SQL database is using "Windows Authentication" with windows domain account FID.

Better to do impersonation only in IIS.
Do not do impersonation in web.config of app like:
  <identity impersonate="true" userName="NAM\FIDRiskPortalUAT" />
if impersonation is enabled in web.config, then FID user permissions has to be provided on 
"c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Temporary ASP.NET Files\" folder also which is not the recommended.

Thereby only do impersonation in IIS at App Pool level by:
* Creating new application pool in IIS.
* Provide the identity of the SQL server domain account instead of "AppPoolIdentity". 
  ( same domain account which is mentioned on connection string )

Impersonation can be done @ website level also instead of App pool level by:
* Setting UId and Password in website advanced settings / Physical Path Credentials (which is right under  Physical Path)
  
* Thereby if MVC app is a Intranet App then in IIS authentication section will have:
    1) Windows auth enabled
    2) impersonation disabled
    3) Anonymous auth disabled (this is important)
