Steps to schedule task in Windows 2008 server R2:

Step 1. If existing solution is built in VS2010, migrate code in VS 2013 and switch to .net framework 4.0

step 2: Go to VS2013 solution project properties (F4) and click on "Compile" tab.

step 3: Change Target CPU from "AnyCPU" to "x86".
        if its targeted to "AnyCPU" (which is by default), the exe throws and exception on execution on server.
	Exception: The 'Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0' provider is not registered on the local machine.
	Note: This exception is generated if we execute exe built for 32 bit machines on 64 bit machines.

step 4: If job requires downloading files from sharepoint, use .net webclient for the same.

Step 5: Run webclient using the account credentials which had admin access on the target machines which executes the exe.

	Dim client As New WebClient()
        Dim cc As New NetworkCredential("<USER ID>", "<PASSWORD>", "<DOMAIN>")
	client.Credentials = cc

        //client.UseDefaultCredentials = True
        client.DownloadFile("<SHAREPOINT URL WITH FILENAME>", "<DOWNLOAD PATH as in C:\windows\<filename> >") 

        Note: specifying UseDefaultCredentials = True does not work on Win 2008 server R2 due to enhanced security issues.
        specifying just filename in Download path works in Win 2003 but same does not work on Win 2008 R2.
        It does work on Win 2003 server and there is no need to provide "NetworkCredential".
        On Win 2003 server though, its important to provide "ASPNET" account full access to the exe.
	Also the FID should have access on the exe.

Step 6: On Task Scheduler, configure as below.
        a) Open Server manager (from taskbar) in WIn 2008 R2.
	b) Go to Configuration/ Task Scheduler/ Task Scheduler Library.
	c) Right click on "Task Scheduler Library" and create basic task. configure options on window.
	d) Make sure to do the following while configuring.
		i. select radiobutton "Run whether user is logged in or not".
			(this ensures that exe will run even if user is not logged into server)
		ii.select radiobutton "Do not store password........"
		iii. select checkbox "Run with Highest privileges"	
	e) In configure for dropdown, select R2.
	f) In start program option, select the batch file which will execute the exe.
        g) Specify the entire batch file path in "program/script" textbox. No need to add anything in arguments or start in
	h) In batch file specify the command,
	i) Schedule time weekly or daily specifying the time as required.
		
         start /d "c:\<folder name>" <exe name here>
